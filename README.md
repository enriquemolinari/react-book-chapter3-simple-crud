# Simple CRUD in React

Simple CRUD is a single page application built with React (and Vite) as part of my book [Understanding React](https://leanpub.com/understandingreact). It was built using the [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) components.

The book is completely **free** for my students (if you want to read it, just write to me).
